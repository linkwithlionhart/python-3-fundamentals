#1 Count letters
"""
Define the function to accept one parameter â€” the word whose letters we are counting
Create a counter to keep track of unique letters
Loop through every letter in our alphabet string. If the current letter was found in our word, increase our count
Return the count after looping through all letters.

#2 Count X
"""
Define the function to accept two parameters. word for the input string and x for the single character
Create a counter to keep track of the occurrences
Loop through every letter in the string. If the current letter is equal to the input letter, increase our counter
Return the counter after looping through the entire string.

#3 Count Multi X
"""
Define the function to accept two parameters. word for the input string and x for the second string we are searching for
Split the string into substrings based on the second input parameter
Count the number of instances the substring appeared in the first input string based on the split string
Return the result
