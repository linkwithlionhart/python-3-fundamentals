"""
The Fender, a notorious computer hacker and general villain of the people, 
has compromised several top-secret passwords including your own. 
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is threefold. 
You must acquire access to The Fenderâ€˜s systems, you must update his "passwords.csv" file to scramble the secret data. 
The last thing you need to do is add the signature of Slash Null, 
a different hacker whose nefarious deeds could be very conveniently halted by The Fender if they viewed Slash Null as a threat.
